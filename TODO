Todo before first release:

- nick, server, ircname configurable (ircname perhaps fixed for now)
- display of notices? (private) notices to active window?
- Add icq support: http://www-jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk/~mwh21/hacks/pyicqlib.html
  (better make this optional?)
- use CLIST for channeluserlist
- support for bold, underline, inverse and colors in text
- port to windows
- support for global cfg structe where settings can be restored/retrieved.

- dcc (send, chat)
- rewrite view-stuff, make txtview (sort of) base for all views
  (which gives us a depent api as well)

gtkview:

- mode checkboxes
- more complete menu's
- support deletion of server windows/tabs

- status somewhere (usermode, away) - in servertab/win? (statusbar in tabwin?)
- channelbuttons
- split channelscreen? (circus)
- view log option (like verybuddy), shows previous sessions

small stuff:

- tabs aren't always properly higlighted, it seems.
- show tree in usable state, i.e. with nodes expanded (should be
  configurable eventually)
- closing serverconnections / tabs / windows
- make /new command jump to new tab?
- store/remember/configure window sizes
- better functioning usermenu's
