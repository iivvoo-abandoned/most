- selected nicks in the channellist get deselected if their mode changes
  (because of delete/add in usermodechange)
- the model isn't updated appropriately, i.e. with channel-usermode changes
  (chanusermodes fixed, 28/7/01)
- bans aren't initialized on join - remove may cause keyerror (fixed, 28/7/01)
- An error resulting from a write from a gui-thread will result in a deadlock
  in serverDispatcher.server_handler
- invalidate channelstates on disconnect (so you can close channelwindows in 
  a disconnected server)
- nickchanges aren't tracked in the tree widget (i.e. queries and channel users) 
- dalnet recognizes most as a spambot, probably because of the USER reg. 
  (fixed, 2/9/01)
- messagewindow nickname selection after opening a query sometimes fails.

:irc.nl.uu.net 406 VladDrac pluck :There was no such nickname

Note that you should really be using the GdkColormap.alloc method to
allocate colours in order to be portable.  Code like the following:
  cmap = widget.get_colormap()
  colour = cmap.alloc("red")  # you can use strings
  colour = cmap.alloc(0xffff, 0, 0) # or 16-bit quantities
