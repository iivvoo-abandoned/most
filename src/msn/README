geheel asynchroon. Methods worden aangeroepen en genereren asynchrone events
(net als irc).

sommige asynchrone events worden direkt afgevangen, zoals:

- XFR
- USR (authenticatie stappen)


Session Semantics
-----------------

A session is a 1-n chat on a switchboard. It can be used for both 1-1 chatting
and 1-n chatting. This means that a session does not have 1 specific target
(actually, n can be 0!)

Some clients will remove connections to the switchboard after a certain period.

In a 1-1 setup, after one of the clients drops the connection, the connection
is re-established through a standard cal/ring. In a 1-n (n > 1), the client
will be explicitly removed from the session, and has to be reinvited explicitly.

Once a client signs of (and no longer has a SB connection), he is assumed to
have left the session.
