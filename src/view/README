This directory contains several different (user) interfaces for most.

API's have not been defined yet, so please reverse engineer the existing
ones if you plan to build a new interface :)

At this moment, there are 3 views available:

txtview - a minimal, simple, trivial, text-only view (no curses). This may
          also be a very usefull base for views in general (as has been done
          with awtview)
awtview - an AWT based view for use with jython (this view won't work with
          cpython!). Based on txtview (and heavily derived from the code),
          so very minimalistic
gtkview - a GTK based view. Currently the most advanced GUI by far. Won't work
          (of course) with Jython.

Suggestions for other views:

- curses based, perhaps with colorsupport, etc. This should exist next to
  the standard txtview, as a cursesbased view won't work with Jython
- Qt based. I already have a volunteer for this.
- Swing, to make Most a nifty jython client as well. (I may work on this myself)

update 23/01/2002

The event handling code has been extensively rewritten, guiMessage has 
disappeared and viewHandler/metaHandler have been introduced as base classes 
for event handling classes.

At this moment, only gtkview uses this, the other views are heavily broken.
