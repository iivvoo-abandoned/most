This implementation is basically the txtview multiplexed over multiple 
windows. Lots can be added, though I don't know if it's worth the effort
(perhaps work on a more complete swing based GUI?)

Things that should be implemented are:

- window handling (closing)
- textarea doesnt (always?) scroll down -- fixed
- shutdown isn't perfect.
