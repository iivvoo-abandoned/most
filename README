Welcome to MOST

MOST stands for "Ministry Of Silly Talks", derived from the Monty Python
sketch 'Ministry of silly walks'

Because IRC is silly :)

MOST is under continuous development so the information below may not
always fully reflect the code.

License:

Please check the file LICENSE which you should have received with MOST.

Available functionality:

- Basic windowing support:
  - main server window
  - channel windows with userlist
  - msg window to receive messages 
  - query window for 1-1 communication

- Support for display of common channel events:
  - mode
  - kick
  - join/leave
  - msg 

- Some commands:
  - join
  - leave
  - me (action)
  - msg
  - nick

Lacking functionality:

- Support for non-unix platforms. It should be possible to port this
  client to Windows (and I will try this soon)
- lots of commands
- dcc
- ctcp (except for sending/receiving CTCP ACTION, some basic responses)
- scripting (but this is definately planned!)
- server selection window
- etc..

Using / installing MOST:
------------------------

MOST currently lacks a nice configuration GUI for nickname, ircname, servers
etc. nickname, servername and port are specified on the commandline or 
through environment variables.

Through commandline:

./most.py nickname servername[:port]

i.e. ./most.py VladDrac irc.openprojects.net:6667

Through environment variables:

export IRCNICK=VladDrac
export IRCNAME=irc.openprojects.net:6667
./most.py

If you wish to install a notify list, this is done through the NOTIFY
environment variable (and only this way), i.e.
export NOTIFY="VladDrac Bert Ernie"

Warning!
--------

MOST is currently still very immature. It may (will) not have all the 
functionality you would expect. Actually, you may find the current 
release disappointing. The motto is release early, release often, and
that's why I've released it at this stage (and to satisfy the folks on
#python :)

About the code:
---------------

I'm trying to use the MVC design pattern (model - view - controller), where
the view is the gui, model is the state of the client and the controller
mediates between these two (and the ircserver). Keep this in mind when browsing
the code. 

How to contact me:

Bug reports:
------------

Please try to include as much information as possible, including version
numbers, tracebacks, actions taken to trigger / cause the bug, etc.
