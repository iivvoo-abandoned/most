#
# script to integrate <ry> bot on #Python more into channel

#
# There is no scripting API yet, but this would be a nice script,
# so I can brainstorm here what would be required in MOST to make
# this work

#
# Install privmsg handler on <channel> (or hardcoded: #Python)
#
# Catch anything from <nickname> (or hardcoded: ry), scan for
# type of message (i.e. <ry> <foo@opn> blah would be a privmsg, etc)
# and display appropriately with <nickname> removed
